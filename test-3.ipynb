This figure fluctuated before climbing steeply to peak at 80% in 1994. However, from then on, it dropped steadily to 70% in 2010. In 1982, half of all glass containers were recycled; after falling below 40% in 1990, the glass recycling rate gradually increased to 60% by 2010.\\nAluminum cans were first recycled in 1986, starting at about 5%, but this figure increased rapidly over 25 years, and by 2010, it had reached 45%. In contrast, plastic recycling was not introduced until 1990, and although the growth in this category was also steady, it was very slow, rising from about 2% to around 8% over the period.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Overall\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.2583057392117916,\n        \"min\": 6.5,\n        \"max\": 9.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6.5,\n          9.0,\n          8.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"TR\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.0408329997330665,\n        \"min\": 7.0,\n        \"max\": 9.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7.5,\n          9.0,\n          7.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"CC\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.5275252316519465,\n        \"min\": 6.0,\n        \"max\": 9.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6.0,\n          9.0,\n          8.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"LR\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.5275252316519465,\n        \"min\": 6.0,\n        \"max\": 9.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6.0,\n          9.0,\n          7.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"GRA\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.7320508075688772,\n        \"min\": 6.0,\n        \"max\": 9.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          9.0,\n          6.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
